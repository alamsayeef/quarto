## Some background 

-   I come from small village in India called Antar Dwipa with a population of 20000 close to that of Steinkjer.
-   I have moved around a bit all over India pursing education, having left my home at the age of 16.
-   Finished up my MPhil from IIPS, Mumbai in 2021
-   Worked as Health Economic Consultant at Parexel
-   Always aspired to pursue doctoral studies abroad and finally joined NTNU on 1 April 2022.

## A PhD on genetics of celiac disease

-   This project peaked my interest while I was working on variable selection methods in high dimensional setting of genetic data for my masterâ€™s thesis.
-   Genetic studies in Europe on celiac disease have included diagnosed cases.
-   They primary involved high-risk population viz. diagnosed patients, first or second degree relative and also among pediatric patient cases.

## continued

-   We wish to include even the general population into consideration because we know that between 4 to 7 cases go undiagnosed for each diagnosed case.
-   Hopefully including such an unselected population might reveal some novel associations.
-   Polygenic risk scores to assess the individual genetic load and how it is distributed in the population.
-   We wish to prognose the disease using genetic environmental and changed clinical expressions.
